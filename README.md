Exercise 1.1
git status shows uncommitted files. .gitignore keeps temporary files from being committed. obj folder in this case
git remote add origin connects local repo to remote repo on github acc (?)
git push does a "check in" from local repo to the remote repo (?)
added hash in GitViz under head -> master
after push to origin, both point to same hash

Exercise 1.2
Remote is an alias of the url it is being pointed to
-u means upstream. links repo to the "main" one
Should the readme not be in <h1>? Looks like mine is broken
Connection between local repo name and remote? no idea
remove remote by git remove remote
Looks the same to me compared to method 1

Exercise 1.3
git status deleted when delete command used
c2 delete is staged which is a benefit in it being one less step to do (?)
numbers always increases
bin and obj files ignored
